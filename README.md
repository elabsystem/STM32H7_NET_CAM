# W5300 Network Camera for Real Time AI with STM32H7

A typical network camera sends compressed images due to network bandwidth. Compressed images can be problematic for image processing because they are degraded in quality. Using the W5300, we created a camera that can transmit uncompressed original images over the network and process the images.

Since the W5300 is capable of high-speed network transmission over 80Mbps, it is the best example for transmitting real-time original images from a camera.
